Hello {{ attendee.first_name }},

You're receiving this email because you've signed up to work in the {{ c.EVENT_NAME }} Staff Suite. Thank you! And thank you for signing up for shifts. We still have a few more shifts if you need the hours. We can't wait to work with you. We just have a few things to get through with you. To report for your shift, visit room 5217 on the 5th floor of the hotel. We work out of two conference suites. Plan for elevator travel times when coming to shifts! 

1. Hair has to be covered on shift. So you can bring a hat or bandana, or you can use one of the bouffants we'll have ready. 

2. For food safety purposes, we ask that all jewelry on hands and wrists be removed, medical jewelry is fine. Leave them in your room (lots of people coming in and out). In the same vein, sleeves have to be rolled up. 

3. You must wash your hands regularly. You are also required to wear gloves. We have vinyl powder-free gloves in Small, Medium, Large, and Extra-Large available. Change gloves frequently. Non-food item? Change gloves. Peanut Butter? Change them. Meat? Definitely. Do not save gloves to put back on later. We have tons of gloves! 

4. We'll give you an apron to wear. Keeps your clothes clean, and helps us identify you quickly as we learn your names! (You'll see!) Just return it at the end of your shift! 

5. If you have any questions, there will always be a supervisor or department head around. Look for a black apron or chef coat! When in doubt, ask! Nothing is trivial when it's a safety concern. Department Heads are Louis, David, Heather and Terri. Heather is around in the morning and David and Louis come in for lunch and dinner. Terri floats and wrangles the carry out section. 

6. Report ALL injuries, incidents, and accidents. ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING. We cannot play around with safety here. This includes anyone that should not be there. Do not try to solve issues on your own. Tell a member of management and let them handle it.

7. When on shift, you are expected to be sober and awake. Intoxication during your shift will result in immediate dismissal and banning from serving on future shifts. There are so many things that can wrong around food if you are drunk. 

8. Can you cosplay on shift? Sure! But the other rules still apply, hair back and covered (wigs too), sleeves rolled, nothing that can affect food. You will have an apron to cover the front. MAGFest and it's Staff Suite cannot be held accountable for any damages that may occur.

If you have any questions. Just let us know. I suggest you bring a hat! (The bouffants suck!)

Also, keep a look out for another email or the website : staffsuite.magfe.st. Information on the different roles will be going up prior to MAGFest. 

Thanks!
