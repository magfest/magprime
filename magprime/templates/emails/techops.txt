Hey {{ attendee.first_name }}, thanks for offering to volunteer with the Tech Ops department for {{ c.EVENT_NAME }}!

Just to make sure you're where you want to be, TechOps handles the audio/visual gear of panels, operates the network at MAGFest events, and deploys a decent number of laptops for event use.

If you're wondering what we're looking for, we've got a rough document about what we're looking for in staffers: https://docs.google.com/document/d/133w5OLTcVibPkq7rtlfrCd9-2koSmMHIDqeKNVQd6Sk/

We're always looking for people who have interest or experience in tech stuff, so don't be afraid to shoot us an email at techops@magfest.org if you have any questions, or just to introduce yourself.

We look forward to seeing you at an event soon (or sooner — we’ll have more gatherings scheduled to get ready for the next event!)

-Tech Ops Department Heads
