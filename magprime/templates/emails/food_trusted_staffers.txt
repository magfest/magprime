Hello Trusted Volunteers,

Hopefully everyone has signed up for shifts! If you run into any trouble, just let us know!

Remember that at this point, we trust you to be left alone to run the room for a while. Seize the opportunity and let's see some great work!

So this year we have quite a few new things to share with you. Jenny and Ben have journeyed to the attendee side, Heather has moved up from Manager to Department Head, and the menu has been entirely revamped. The goal this year is to make our lives easier as a department by streamlining cooking, simplifying menu items, and offering more options. Less work for us, happier consumers.

The website should be going live a little over two weeks before event. The menu, location of suite, and new policies for the departments will be listed on the site. If you're not a member of our facebook group, you might be want to consider joining to get updates from us!


If you need anything, please ask us!
