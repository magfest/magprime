You are receiving this email because you are listed as a MAGFest Department Head of the {{ attendee.assigned_depts_labels.0 }} department.

While you might not be the actual Department Head, but one of many within your department, you are on the list to receive the Department Head Checklist.

This means that you have access in Rams/Uber to go to:

These are all steps that are needed in order for your volunteers to sign up for shifts, for your department to get the MPoints that you need, for your staffers that are qualified to get into MAGFest Crash space (especially those coming early or staying late), etc.
