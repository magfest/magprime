TODO DATE TODO!!!!! CHANGME!

{{ attendee.first_name }},

This year's "MAGCon" staff meeting starts at noon on TODO DATE TODO at the Gaylord Hotel in room Chesapeake DEF.  This isn't just a department heads meeting - it's open to everyone who wants to get more involved and see how {{ c.EVENT_NAME }} is run.

Limited crash space is available before and after for people from out of town.  We will also be attempting to stream this meeting (no promises).

Let us know if you have any questions!
