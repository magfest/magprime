    You are receiving this e-mail because you're a staffer eligible for complimentary shirts.
    We've <a href="{{ c.URL_BASE }}/staffing/shirt_size">added a step to the volunteer checklist</a>

    substitute one of them for the standard event themed swag shirt. We are printing shirts very soon,
    so please complete this step no later than <b>{{ c.VOLUNTEER_SHIRT_DEADLINE|datetime_local }}</b>.
