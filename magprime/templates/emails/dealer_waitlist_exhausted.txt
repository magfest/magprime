<br/><br/>Although your group ({{ group.name}}) was not taken off the waitlist, we think you may still want to come and enjoy all that {{ c.EVENT_NAME }} has to offer!

<br/><br/>Therefore, we have reserved a badge for you{% if c.PRICE_BUMPS and attendee.badge_cost < c.BADGE_PRICE %} at the price of registration when you first applied{% endif %}. Badges went to anyone in your group who had a valid email on the badge, and any unassigned badges were dropped.

<br/><br/>Please go ahead and confirm or decline <a href="{{ c.URL_BASE }}/preregistration/confirm?id={{ attendee.id }}">your registration</a>. We hope to see you this year!
