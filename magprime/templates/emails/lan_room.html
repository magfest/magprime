{{ attendee.first_name }},
<p>You are receiving this email because you ticked an interest in <i>PC Gaming</i> (LAN) while pre-registering for MAGFest.</p>
<h4>Reminders</h4>
<p>We highly recommend bringing your own computer to fully enjoy the MAGFest LAN experience. <b>Please note: Due to limited availability, we do not allow tournament participation using a public play PC except for specifically indicated events.</b></p>
<p>Please pre-register your LAN items by <a href="https://forms.gle/BE5zGqeiDh47MKt59">filling out our online form</a> to zip through initial check-in. We are primarily focused on registering <b>Desktops</b>, <b>Monitors</b>, and <b>Laptops</b>. If you plan to keep smaller devices like a Nintendo Switch or Steam Deck on you, there's no need to register them. Likewise, peripherals such as <b>keyboards</b>, <b>mice</b>, <b>headphones</b>, and other computer equipment do not need to be registered.</p>
<p>Bring an ethernet cable 20 feet long or longer. If gaming on a laptop, make sure it has a wired network port or USB network adapter. Limited quantities of network adapters will be available at the event, but we recommend preparing ahead of time.</p>
<p>Please update your OS and games before coming to MAGFest LAN. We try our best to provide enough bandwidth for everyone&mdash;saving every little bit counts. We don't want anyone stuck waiting hours for updates while friends play!</p>
<h4>MAGFest LAN Rules</h4>
<ul>
    <li><b>Please try to keep your setup contained.</b> You must be able to fit in a 30" deep by 36" wide space (half a table) if we reach capacity.</li>
    <li><b>Use headphones</b>, not speakers. We highly recommend WIRED headphones and peripherals due to potential signal interference. </li>
    <li><b>Leave networking equipment at home.</b> We have plenty of ports.</li>
    <li><b>Bring a power strip.</b> You must only plug your power strip into the one we provide your table. DO NOT DAISY-CHAIN MULTIPLE POWERSTRIPS.</li>
    <li><b>Enter and exit only through the checkpoint.</b> Other doors are alarmed.</li>
    <li><b>Sleep in your hotel room.</b> Keyboard napping OK; sleeping bags NOT OK.</li>
    <li><b>Please adhere to the <a href='http://super.magfest.org/codeofconduct/'>MAGFest Code of Conduct</a>.</b> This includes the prohibition of smoking, vaping, and the consumption of alcohol in MAGFest function spaces.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Public Free-Play Computers</h4>
<p>This year, we're increasing the number public play PCs with the help of our partners at <a href="https://lanfest.com/">LANfest</a> and <a href="https://frag.to/">FRAG</a> who are providing over one-hundred and fifty Public Play PCs.</p>
<h4>Location</h4>
<p>This year we return to the Maryland Ballroom with a new layout. MAGFest's Museum and PC VR stations will be sharing our space. We will continue to use the <i>MAGLAN BarcodeSystem</i> for item security. However, <i><u>MAGFest is NOT RESPONSIBLE and accepts NO LIABILITY for ANY attendee equipment</u></i>. Please keep this in mind while attending MAGFest LAN and <b>secure your personal belongings appropriately!</b></p>
<p>Upon passing the LAN checkpoint, you will find the Public PC and LAN Theater areas. The BYOC section is located further back in the Maryland Ballroom.</p>
<p>We expect high demand for seats again, so arrive early to claim your spot!</p>
