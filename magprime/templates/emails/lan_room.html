You are receiving this email because you ticked an interest in <i>PC Gaming</i> (LAN) while pre-registering for MAGFest. We highly recommend bringing your own computer to fully enjoy the MAGFest LAN experience. There are public play PCs with limited availability. <b>You need prior approval from LAN staff to participate in a tournament using a public play PC.</b>

<br/> <br/>
The Check-in process is fully optimized! Please <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdD5ov74Ur5HP1KuhqGRB5I3LPDnK0K--rYE0u_OiNvdAyyXQ/viewform">fill out our online form</a> to pre-register your items. We hope this helps you fly through initial check-in with ease!
<br/> <br/>
Achievements! Every attendee is scanned in and out of the LAN room&mdash;earn MPoints for achievements like: who stays in the room the longest, and who enters the room with the same people the most. More information at-event. (Psst, we're probably doing it live.)
<br/> <br/>
Our single LAN Theater is the size of last year's theaters combined. Enter it from within the LAN room&mdash;all spectators must pass through the main security checkpoint.
<br/> <br/>
VR is now under the operation of the Simulations department. Combined with aisle adjustments, capacity increases to over 500 total seats.
<br/> <br/>

<b><u>LOCATION</u></b>
<br/> <br/>
This year we return to the Maryland Ballroom. There is one entrance and one exit which optimizes our ability to make sure your equipment stays put. We continue to use <i>BarcodeSystem</i> for your items' security. However, <i><u>MAGFest is NOT RESPONSIBLE and accepts NO LIABILITY for ANY attendee equipment</u></i>. Please keep this in mind while attending MAGFest LAN and <b>secure your personal belongings appropriately!</b>
<br/> <br/>
We expect high demand for seats again, so arrive early to claim your spot!
<br/> <br/>

<b><u>LAN THEATER</u></b>
<br/> <br/>
Our LAN Theater redesign increases quality and provides additional space for organizing tournaments. The entrance is in the front of the LAN room, and is the ideal place to watch many of our great LAN events. We plan to livestream with color commentary, so come see the best gamers competing to be #1! We increased the size of the room, so be sure to come by and support competitive PC gaming. Remember to tell your friends to come as well&mdash;they might get to the chance to cheer you on!
<br/><br/>
There is also some late night content in the LAN Theater, so keep an eye out for that. Stop by and check out what's planned!
