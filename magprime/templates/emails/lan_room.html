<b><u>NEWS</u></b>

This year the LAN room will feature three VR pods where attendees can come and try out various VR experiences on the Oculus Rift and HTC Vive!

As for tournaments and the LAN Theater, we will have two theaters (A and B) with overflow space in the LAN room.

Our premiere 10 gigabit backbone network with 1 gigabit client ports will be returning as well, bigger and better than ever.

<b><u>LOCATION</u></b>
<br/> <br/>
This year we return to the Maryland Ballroom. There is one entrance and exit which optimizes our ability to make sure your equipment stays put.

Please keep this in mind while attending MAGFest LAN and secure your personal belongings appropriately!</i>
