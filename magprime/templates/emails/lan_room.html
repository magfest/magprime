We have increased the size of our LAN Theater, however there will be only one of them this year. The main entrance for the theater will be inside of the LAN room and all spectators must go through the security checkpoint to reach the Theater.
<br/> <br/>
Our premiere 10 gigabit backbone network with 1 gigabit client ports will be returning as well, bigger and better than ever.
<br/> <br/>
<b><u>LOCATION</u></b>
<br/> <br/>
This year we return to the Maryland Ballroom. There is one entrance and exit which optimizes our ability to make sure your equipment stays put. We are continuing use of the <i>BarcodeSystem</i> for your items' security. However, <i><u>MAGFest is NOT RESPONSIBLE and accepts NO LIABILITY for ANY attendee equipment</u>. Please keep this in mind while attending MAGFest LAN and secure your personal belongings appropriately!</i>
<br/> <br/>
We have removed VR (moved to Simulations) and adjusted the aisles to increase our capacity to over 500 total seats, but you are advised to arrive by mid-day Friday to secure a spot.

<b><u>TOURNAMENTS</u></b>
<br/> <br/>
There are 15 tournaments planned for this year. Along with our events on the main MAGFest schedule, we have a selection of ad-hoc events running in the background. You can find all of the info on our tournaments on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/magfestlan/comments/7mdrcs/magfest_2018_rules_tournament_schedule_and/">Reddit</a>.
<br/> <br/>
<b><u>LAN THEATER</u></b>
<br/> <br/>
In an attempt to focus on quality and to have additional space for tournament organization we have redesigned the logistics of the Theater. The Theater entrance is in the front of the LAN room, and is the perfect place to watch many of our premier tournaments. We plan to be livestreaming from the Theater with color commentary, so you can come see the best MAGFest has to offer competing to be #1! We increased the size of the room, so be sure to come by and support competitive PC gaming. Don’t forget to tell your friends to come as well, they might get to the chance to cheer you on!
<br/><br/>
We also have included some late night content in the LAN Theater, so keep an eye out for that. Stop by and check out what we have planned!
