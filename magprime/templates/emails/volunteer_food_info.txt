Thank you for volunteering at {{ c.EVENT_NAME }} this year. We feed our volunteers three meals per day during {{ c.EVENT_NAME }}, you may drop by the Hospitality Suite in Room 5217 on the 5th floor of the hotel anytime during {{ c.EVENT_NAME }}. Meals will be served at the following times: 

Breakfast: 8:00 am to 11:00 am
Lunch: 12:00 pm to 3:00 pm
Dinner: 6:00 pm to 8:00 pm

We also have a grab and go station available 24/7 with snacks and fruit. 

Note: No queuing is allowed in the hallway. If meal service has not yet started, please come in and get a snack.

Gluten free, vegan, and non-dairy dishes are available.  If your dietary restrictions are not met by the food on the line, please alert any of our service staff.

{% if attendee.badge_type == c.ATTENDEE_BADGE %}If you are signed up for more than 12 hours, you will become eligible to eat in Staff Suite after working your first shift. Please visit Staff Ops (Azalea 3) after you get your badge to get your shift schedule. Have your department head sign your schedule after you work your first shift, then return to Staff Ops to get your ribbon punched.

{% endif %}The first meal served is breakfast on Thursday morning, and the suite will remain open 24/7 through Sunday afternoon.

Carryout is available for volunteers & staff who are scheduled to work during meal service hours. Department Heads will have meal signup forms for lunch and dinner. Please note any dietary restrictions.

Staff does have access to the Gaylord’s staff cafeteria - Galaxy Cafe’ - at their own expense.  The procedure has changed a little this year.  If you want to eat there, before you head there, you need to go to STOPs in Azalea 3 and pick up a voucher for that meal - you can pick up vouchers in advance if you know you want to eat there.  When you go to Galaxy Cafe, you need to present the voucher to the cashier, and they will charge you the amount on it, which is a flat $12 for either breakfast, lunch or dinner.  You can get to Galaxy Cafe by walking to the back of the Maryland Ballroom foyer (where MegaManaThon will be running), going to the back hallway, turning left, and then opening the door next to the Security station and going downstairs, where the hallway entrance to the cafe’ will be on your right.  A gentle reminder: this cafe is for the Gaylord employees, and is one of the spaces where they don’t have to be “on.” Be courteous and deferential, this is their space that they are letting us use.
