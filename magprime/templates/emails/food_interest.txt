Hello {{ attendee.first_name }}!

Thank you for not only signing up to volunteer at {{ c.EVENT_NAME }}, but to volunteer with the Staff Suite. If you are confused, then allow me to explain. When you signed up to volunteer, you either checked any or specifically checked “Staff Suite” as a requested department to work in.

If you are unfamiliar with Staff Suite, it’s part of the perks of volunteering. We are the ones who cook and provide the 3 meals a day, as well as snacks and drinks. Tasks could include badge checking, serving food, preparing and cooking food, cleaning and washing dishes, maintaining supplies, and other miscellaneous jobs as needed. We are always on the lookout for volunteers who are willing to put in the time and effort and make a significant contribution to this department and MAGFest as a whole.

If you are still interested in working with us, then GREAT! Please fill out the form here http://goo.gl/forms/SkRL9depRC. Please note that lack of experience will not exclude you from joining us. Your answers are only for informational purposes.

If you are no longer interested in working with us, please let us know as soon as possible, and we will get that corrected within the system.

Otherwise, we look forward to working with you, if you have any questions please let us know!

Thanks!

MAGFest Staff Suite
