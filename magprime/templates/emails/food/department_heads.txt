Dear Department Heads,

Staff Suite has, as you know, had some changes this year. We are now serving catered dinners and a cold menu for breakfast / lunch.

Most of the previous policies remain in effect: 

Carryout will be handled in the same way (please pick up your order forms from #5217, we’ll have them printed and ready)

Gatorade and water reservations have been calculated by last year’s consumption. Beverages will be available for pickup from 11AM-3PM at Expo E (behind Autographs) Thursday, Friday and Saturday.

Carryout orders are only available for lunch and dinner, and only for volunteers/staff who are scheduled to work through meal service hours.
