Thanks again for coming out to {{ c.EVENT_NAME }} as a Guest! As we've previously mentioned, we feed our guests three meals per day during {{ c.EVENT_NAME }}, so you can drop by the Hospitality Suite in Room 5217 on the 5th floor of the hotel for snacks at any time and for food during any of the following times:

Breakfast: 8:00 am to 11:00 am
Lunch: 12:00 pm to 3:00 pm
Dinner: 6:00 pm to 8:00 pm
SUITE IS OPEN 24/7 WITH SNACKS & GRAB AND GO

The first meal served will be breakfast on Thursday morning, and the suite will remain open through Sunday afternoon. Sunday will have a breakfast option, but once breakfast is over, leftovers will be served. You will be able to help yourself. Please feel free to bring tupperware or storage bags to carry items home. You will be responsible for their proper storage.
