    Due to a technical difficulty, we do not yet have reservation links for attendees to confirm their room awards by putting down their credit cards. 
    The room award in this email is complete, and we will send out another email once we have reservation links to allow you to confirm or decline the 
    award. <b>This email will go out no earlier than Monday, October 6 and you will still have a week from the sending of that email to put down a credit 
    card to confirm your award.</b> Weâ€™re sorry for the inconvenience, but we wanted to get out the lottery award notifications themselves as soon as 
    possible.
