Many sections of the Volunteer Checklist for Super MAGFest are now live, including the Staff Crash Space Hotel Request Form! The staff hotel crash space section is due November 17 by midnight. You will be able to request and anti-request other staffers through this form. You will be assigned to a hotel room with up to 3 other staffers. Please mention any special needs via the text box (accessibility, feather allergy, etc.) You can accept or decline this offer as part of our volunteer checklist at {{ c.URL_BASE }}/staffing/login?first_name={{ attendee.first_name|urlencode }}&last_name={{ attendee.last_name|urlencode }}&email={{ attendee.email|urlencode }}&zip_code={{ attendee.zip_code|urlencode }}

If you don't sign up by {{ c.ROOM_DEADLINE|datetime_local }} then you will not receive hotel room space.

All volunteers who receive hotel room space must sign up for at least {{ c.HOURS_FOR_HOTEL_SPACE }} weighted hours worth of shifts.

If you have trouble with the login information, please go to: {{ c.URL_BASE }}/preregistration/confirm?id={{ attendee.id }} and verify your registration information.

Please let us know if you have any questions.
