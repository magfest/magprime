Many sections of the Volunteer Checklist for Super MAGFest are now live, including the Staff Crash Space Hotel Request Form! The staff hotel crash space section is due {{ c.ROOM_DEADLINE.date().strftime('%B %-d') }} by {{ c.ROOM_DEADLINE.time().strftime('%-I:%M %p') }}. You will be able to request and anti-request other staffers through this form. You will be assigned to a hotel room with up to 3 other staffers. Please mention any special needs via the text box (accessibility, feather allergy, etc.) You can accept or decline this offer as part of our volunteer checklist at {{ c.URL_BASE }}/staffing/login?first_name={{ attendee.first_name|urlencode }}&last_name={{ attendee.last_name|urlencode }}&email={{ attendee.email|urlencode }}&zip_code={{ attendee.zip_code|urlencode }}

If you don't sign up by {{ c.ROOM_DEADLINE|datetime_local }} then you will not receive hotel room space.

All volunteers who receive hotel room space must sign up for at least {{ c.HOURS_FOR_HOTEL_SPACE }} weighted hours worth of shifts.

If you have trouble with the login information, please go to: {{ c.URL_BASE }}/preregistration/confirm?id={{ attendee.id }} and verify your registration information.

Please let us know if you have any questions.
