<br><br>Please remember to also pick up your Staff shirt from STOPS at pre-reg on Wednesday night, or Thursday-Sunday in STOPS.
While you are encouraged to wear your shirt while on shift, it is not required. Former year staff shirts are allowed, 
so long as they are in good condition. When not on shift, you should wear a different shirt, so you can enjoy {{ c.EVENT_NAME }} 
with everyone else.

    If you'd like, you can print this out for your own reference. If your 
    department head isn't able to mark off your shift electronically, you 
    can have them sign this and bring it to STOPS so we can.
    <br><br>
    If you forget to print out this sheet and would like to pick up a spare
    copy, or if you want to change your hours, you can drop by Staffing Ops
    during {{ c.EVENT_NAME }}.
