{% endif %}Hey all! Weâ€™re so excited to see you at Super {{ c.EVENT_YEAR }}! You're eligible for a complimentary badge for the next {{ c.EVENT_NAME }}, which will be {{ event_dates() }} {{ c.EVENT_YEAR }}. You can accept your badge by visiting {{ c.URL_BASE }}/preregistration/confirm?id={{ attendee.id }}.

At this stage, you can choose whether or not you'd like to continue volunteering. By default, the checkbox labeled "Yes, I want to staff MAGFest" is toggled ON, which means you're already enrolled and will receive emails about signups, checklists, etc... If you are not interested in volunteering, you can email STOPS at {{ c.STAFF_EMAIL|email_only }} to ask that your badge be converted to a comped attendee badge. Please note you may only do this once, as staff status must be used at the event for which it is earned. If you choose to convert your badge type, you will need to purchase a badge in subsequent years and start over again as a volunteer.

If you are unable to attend this year for any reason, or would like to take a gap year and purchase an attendee badge, you can contact STOPS to request a one-year deferral.

Staffers who confirm their badges will be emailed when the Volunteer Checklist launches. The Checklist will need to be completed before the event starts, and will have a link to our volunteering guidelines and agreement. As a returning volunteer, you'll also be eligible for crash space in one of our staffer hotel rooms. This is included in our Volunteer Checklist, but you'll be emailed closer to the event with details about how to sign up.

Please let us know if you have any questions.
