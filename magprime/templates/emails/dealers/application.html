We will review your request and provide you with a payment link if your application is approved; otherwise,
you will receive a waitlist or declined email.

<br/><br/><strong>IMPORTANT NOTE</strong>: Make sure you included links to galleries, portfolios, your shop, etc in the application
so we can adequately judge your application. If there is no place online for us to view your product, then please email images of
what you plan to sell to {{ c.MARKETPLACE_EMAIL|email_only }}. If you do not provide links for us to view, then you will be automatically
waitlisted. If you frequently put your shop on vacation mode, then please include links to a gallery elsewhere. If we make 3 attempts
to view a closed shop and are unable to see your wares, we will also automatically waitlist you.

<br/><br/>In the coming weeks, you'll be emailed a link to a page with instructions on booking a room. This link will not initially
be announced publicly, it will be sent to people registered for {{ c.EVENT_NAME }} first, so keep a lookout for the e-mail in case
it goes into your spam folder. It will go to the email address that you provide in your badge information. Receiving the link does
not guarantee you a room.

<br/><br/>Vendor applications automatically reserve the ability to purchase badges for you and the number of assistants on the
application at the pre-registration price of ${{ c.BADGE_PRICE }}, if the application is not approved. PLEASE DO NOT BUY A BADGE
IF YOU APPLIED FOR A MARKETPLACE SPOT. Your ability to purchase the badges will happen after the waitlist is exhausted if you are
not approved to vend.
