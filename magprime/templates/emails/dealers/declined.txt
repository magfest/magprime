Hello {{ group.leader.full_name }},

Thank you for your interest in MAGFest Marketplace. Unfortunately, this year your application for "{{ group.name }}" is being declined. If you still wish to attend without vending, you must purchase an attendee badge once registration opens on September 16th; your application badges will not convert. We hope you have a good rest of your day.
