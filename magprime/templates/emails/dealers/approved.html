    now then it will take much less time for their owners to pick them up at the festival.

<br/> <br/><strong>New Tax Information <span style="color:red">*Please Read*</span></strong>
<p>All sellers in the Marketplace are required to obtain a Seller's Permit from the State of Maryland.
    To ease the burden on the Comptroller's office for issuing mass permits, we submit the names of our sellers in advance 
    to ensure everyone has the right documentation; the Comptroller's office then issues the seller's permits directly to 
    you. In order to make sure we get you your documentation, we need you to fill out 
    <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfxVM_ymIfWbetRfPkLiJmFuIbq-Ap0-W5Xt4xBRxJkHeIMuQ/viewform" target="_blank">this form</a> 
    no later than December 12th, 2021. After that date, you will need to obtain your own permit, 
    directions on how to do this can be found here: 
    <a href="https://tinyurl.com/MAGFestSellers" target="_blank">https://tinyurl.com/MAGFestSellers</a>. 
    <strong>Finally, if you are multiple Artists or Vendors sharing the same table space through an approved table share or 
    you applied and were accepted together: then each individual seller *MUST* fill out the form above and get their 
    exhibitor's affidavit.</strong></p>

<p>TLDR; fill out <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfxVM_ymIfWbetRfPkLiJmFuIbq-Ap0-W5Xt4xBRxJkHeIMuQ/viewform" target="_blank">this form</a>
    no later than December 12th, 2021. Check your email and/or physical mail for your sellers permit that will be 
    sent directly from MD Comptroller. ANY and ALL issues regarding receiving your permit must be directed to the 
    Comptroller's office as we, unfortunately, have no power to help!</p>
