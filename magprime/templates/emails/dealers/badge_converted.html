I am sorry to inform you that all Marketplace spaces have been filled, and unfortunately your group {{ group.name }}
did not make it into {{ c.EVENT_NAME }} Marketplace this year, which is why your application is now being declined.
Please try again next year! Dealer Registration opens up at about the same time each year, usually about a week before
general attendee pre-registration begins. Please follow the MAGFest social media pages to find out when Dealer
Registration will open next year as we make announcements there before it opens.
{% if c.PRICE_BUMPS and attendee.badge_cost < c.BADGE_PRICE %}As a courtesy, the badges in your group have been
converted to attendee badges at the lowest price you could have attained when you applied. {% else %}
The badges in your group have been converted to attendee badges at the prevailing cost at the time you applied. {% endif %}
You can assign and pay for badges using the same Group Leader link you received in your application received email
when you applied. Again, I am very sorry that you did not make it into the Marketplace this year.
<br/><br/>
Danielle Pomfrey,
<br/><br/>
MAGFest Marketplace Coordinator
