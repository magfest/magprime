Once you're done reading that, here's some quick info on the different positions we have available: 

  - General Helper: These are all purpose volunteers who are responsible for duties such as manning sign up tables, general crowd control, keeping time for the open mic, and running the occasional errand (i.e. important, but pretty straightforward stuff). Hours are weighted 1.0.

  - Merch Attendant: This position is weighted because it carries extra responsibilities. Merch Attendants check in & check out merch, track inventory, and handle artists' money. For a lot of artists, the money they make at our merch booth will be the most they sell all year. It's a busy place. Hours are weighted 1.5.

  - Sound Technician: This is also a weighted position because it carries with it extra responsibilities as well as requiring a prerequisite set of skills. Sound Techs operate the mixer, run cables, act as stagehands, troubleshoot  audio gremlins, and work with artists with varying set ups. While we are willing to train on site if need be, we prefer volunteers filling this space to have at least some previous experience in live sound. Hours are weighted 1.5.

- Stream Technician: This is also a weighted position because it carries with it extra responsibilities as well as requiring a prerequisite set of skills. Stream Techs monitor the audio and video streams, run cables, act as a/v techs, troubleshoot video gremlins, and work with visualists with varying set ups . While we are willing to train on site if need be, we prefer volunteers filling this space to have at least some previous experience or familiarity. Hours are weighted 1.5
