    The {{ c.EVENT_NAME }} room lottery is used to allocate all available room types in the {{ c.EVENT_NAME }} room blocks in all National Harbor hotels.
    This includes all available standard rooms, ADA rooms, and suites. These rooms are only available through the lottery, and any
    unclaimed or cancelled rooms will be returned to the lottery pool of available rooms until {{ c.HOTEL_LOTTERY_FORM_DEADLINE|datetime_local("%B %-d, %Y at %-I:%M%p %Z") }}.
    {{ c.ORGANIZATION_NAME }} cannot assist with rooms booked outside our official process â€“ even at hotels we may have a block of rooms with. Beware of scams!

    <ul>
        <li>
            The first round of the lottery is only open to {{ c.EVENT_NAME_AND_YEAR }} attendees who registered and submitted their hotel lottery preferences before {{ c.HOTEL_LOTTERY_FORM_WAITLIST|datetime_local("%B %-d, %Y at %-I:%M%p %Z") }}.
            Attendees who register afterwards can enter their lottery information for later lottery runs to fill cancelled rooms.
        </li>
        <li>The lottery is only open to registered attendees and dealers.</li>
        <li>Only one room entry and one suite entry is allowed per attendee. Entries may be modified or withdrawn while the lottery is open.</li>
        {% if c.SHOW_HOTEL_LOTTERY_GROUPS %}
        <li>Attendees wishing to enter as a group should designate a "group leader" to complete a single room and/or suite entry. The group leader can then invite others to join their group as group members.</li>
        {% endif %}
        <li>The lottery form will ask for your check-in and check-out dates. You then rank your hotel choice and type of room in order of preference.</li>
        <li>If you receive a room award, you must provide valid credit card information for the one-night deposit to be charged. If the reservation is cancelled in accordance with the cancellation policy the deposit will be refunded.</li>
