<h1>Volunteer Agreement</h1>

<p>
MAGFest depends on committed volunteers to make our events happen. We could not do this without you, 
are so grateful for all you do, and the community you have helped to create. To ensure that staff, 
volunteers, attendees, and guests have the best experience possible, we have developed the following 
agreement between volunteers and MAGFest, Inc.</p>

<p>MAGFest, Inc. agrees to:
<ul>
<li>Be forthcoming with information as it pertains to event logistics and changes in policy.</li>
<li>Serve as the liaison between volunteers and employees when needed.</li>
<li>Provide a brief description of duties for positions open to volunteers.</li>
<li>Train and support volunteers where needed.</li>
<li>Provide volunteers with working conditions equal to those of paid employees doing similar work, including space, 
equipment and supplies.</li>
<li>Provide volunteers the opportunity to ask questions, communicate openly, and share any concerns.</li>
<li>Be responsible for the coordination, support, and termination (if necessary) of all volunteers.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>The Volunteer agrees to:
<ul>
<li>Meet the commitment required of chosen position. This includes being aware of pre-event duties or deadlines and 
completing them accordingly.</li>
<li>Become thoroughly familiar with MAGFest's 
<a href="https://super.magfest.org/codeofconduct/" target="_blank">Event Code of Conduct</a>, 
<a href="https://www.notion.so/magfest/Guidelines-Policies-962be148bdcc432c8ee48a16f8bb6410" target="_blank">Volunteer Guidelines and Policies</a>, 
and <a href="https://www.notion.so/magfest/Communications-Code-of-Conduct-cd27b6f1976d4685925cc7a2500e94ed" target="_blank">Communications Code of Conduct</a>.</li>
<li>Carry out duties in alignment with our 
<a href="https://www.notion.so/magfest/Mission-Core-Values-6656a5b2bf3340d183912f4db3211b00" target="_blank">Core Values</a>.</li>
<li>Work all shifts that they have signed up for, being present and prepared to work on time. If unable to work as 
scheduled, they will notify their department supervisor.</li>
<li>Seek the assistance of their immediate supervisor or DH in any situation requiring special guidance.</li>
<li>Provide feedback and suggestions to STOPS in order to increase the effectiveness of the program.</li>
<li>Accept the right of MAGFest, Inc. to dismiss any volunteer for poor performance, including poor attendance.</li>
<li>Notify MAGFest about any resignation, request for a leave of absence, or change of volunteer commitment.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h1>Performance Problems and Disciplinary Actions</h1>
<p>
    In general, volunteers can receive verbal or written warnings of unacceptable behavior or performance and are allowed time and support to improve. <a href="https://www.notion.so/magfest/Staffer-Misconduct-and-Sanctions-245d8188d7ec80608998f0caf90064e7">Information on the disciplinary process, as well as sanctions for specific infractions can be found here.</a>
</p>

<p>MAGFest supports an atmosphere of open discussion of issues between volunteers, staff, and employees.  Should a 
volunteer take exception to a disciplinary action, they may discuss it with the head(s) of STOPS for their event. 
In the case that further arbitration is needed, the Director of Volunteer Infrastructure will have final say on 
disciplinary actions regarding volunteers.</p>

<p>In instances of gross misconduct, warnings may not be possible or desirable for the overall interests of MAGFest, 
event attendees, or the community.  Engaging in any of the following behaviors or actions will not be tolerated and 
may result in immediate termination of duties:
<ul>
<li>Physical assault or threat of violence to anyone involved with the event.</li>
<li>Theft (equipment, supplies, money).</li>
<li>Possession or use of a weapon.</li>
<li>Racial, sexual, or other harassment of anyone involved with the event.</li>
<li>Reckless or deliberate action that endangers the physical or psychological well-being of any person involved with the event, including yourself.</li>
<li>Reckless or deliberate action that damages MAGFest property or property belonging to MAGFest partners.</li>
<li>Reckless or deliberate action which damages the reputation of MAGFest.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>The above list is representative of the types of behavior that will not be tolerated and is not intended to be an 
exhaustive list.</p>

<p>Should a volunteer be accused of engaging in any of these behaviors, MAGFest’s Safety and Security Team, along with 
Staff Operations, will investigate the incident(s) and take appropriate disciplinary action up to and including immediate 
termination.</p>

<p>I, {{ attendee.legal_first_name }} {{ attendee.legal_last_name }}, acknowledge that I have read the volunteering policies and guidelines. I understand the volunteer expectations, and I will fulfill them to the best of my ability. I understand that there may be consequences if I don’t meet these expectations.</p>
