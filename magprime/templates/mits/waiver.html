  <h2>MITS Waiver</h2>

  <p>Hello and Welcome to {{ c.EVENT_NAME_AND_YEAR }}!</p>
  <p>
    We wanted to take a moment and welcome all developers who will be promoting their games this year at the MAGFest Indie Tabletop Showcase,
    and to provide you with our short developer seller’s contract. This sheet is to establish the rules.
    Please read our {% if c.CODE_OF_CONDUCT_URL %} <a href="{{ c.CODE_OF_CONDUCT_URL }}">Code of Conduct here</a>.
    {% else %}full code of conduct, which is available at registration, or we can provide you with a copy if you ask.{% endif %}
    We have all of the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/u/4/d/1Gm4oDOjXL9zAeLaDnspdEfhBeVEdvPLngHUxuqMBnf4/edit" target="_blank">Team Information here</a>.
  </p>

  <p>Rules:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Indemnifying Waiver</strong>: I agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless MAGFest INC, the Gaylord National Resort and 
      Convention Center, and their respective employees and agents against any claims or expenses arising out of the use of the exhibition 
      premises, and I understand that neither MAGFest INC nor the Gaylord National Resort and Convention Center maintains insurance covering 
      my property and it is my sole responsibility to obtain any such insurance.
    </li>
    <li>Be kind to your neighbors and respectful of space. Sometimes space can get a little tight, so be courteous to one another.</li>
    <li>
      Your displays and products cannot block the aisles or walkways. This is a big deal as we must comply with fire code. Please consult us 
      before moving any tables. Your tables or belongings may be moved by us at any time if they violate fire code.
    </li>
    <li>Please be ready to leave the room Sunday, when the room will close for good at 6pm.</li>
    <li>
      You may only sell your game and related merch, and nothing else, and only if you clicked 'yes' to the 'would like to sell' questions in the 
      form AND filled out the tax form before January 3rd.
    </li>
    <li>No selling out of a hotel room, away from the demo area or away from your table; i.e. no peddling.</li>
    <li>MAGFest is not responsible for lost or stolen property.</li>
    <li>
      Do not try to solve a dispute with an attendee or other team at any time, get us to do this for you. You are not on-duty MAGFest staff 
      while presenting.
    </li>
    <li>
      You are required to sign your vendor contract before you set up a sale at your table. If you sell at your table before signing your 
      contract, then you will be fined <strong>$75.00</strong>, which must be paid before you sell anything else. We’re sorry to be so harsh, 
      but this is a serious matter for MAGFest as we need to follow both hotel guidelines and Maryland law.
    </li>
    <li>
      If you do not adhere to the rules set out in this contract, we reserve the right to revoke your ability to demo or sell at MAGFest at 
      any time for any reason.
    </li>
  </ul>
