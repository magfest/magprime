<h1>Barrel Roller</h1>

<p>
  This one's only for the truest of MAG fans. For $200, you will receive
  four of the most insane items we've ever made: resin cast figures of eachÂ 
  of the characters in the Sun Cats crew.
</p>
<p>
  Each figure is modeled N64-style and expertly posed on a stand, with a
  writeable NFC tag in the base. Easily some of the coolest swag we've ever
  had at MAGFest.
