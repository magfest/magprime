<h1>Buster Tier</h1>

<p>
  Okay, <em>NOW</em> we’re talkin’. The Buster Tier includes everything from the T-Shirt Tier, then we crank everything up to X!
</p>

<p>
  Let’s kick things off with the incredible 2026 Pulse Swadge, now featuring 72 MORE LEDs, so your Swadge can handle all of your emoting for you. Brand new games, brand new modes, and a brand new design make this the dopest Swadge yet. Plus, with SwadgePass, you’ll be able to passively connect to those around you with a Swadge, trading scores, unlocking secrets, and so much more!
</p>

<p>
  Let’s Rush through the rest of these sick items: You’ll get custom printed Post-It Notes, a King Donut Chip Clip, an awesome Water Bottle, an eye-exploding 3D Lenticular Print, our patented (not really) “YEAH, LEMONS” Candies, the third annual issue of the 69+ page MAGFest Power Magazine, and a high-quality themed Drawstring Bag to keep everything inside.
</p>

<p>
  Oh, and one more thing. We’re bringin’ back POGS, BABY! That’s right, you’ll get a random selection of custom MAGFest Pogs, featuring gnarly 90s designs and MAG-centric shitposts, that you’ll be able to trade and battle with friends! And rumor has it, there might be more Pogs to collect around MAGFest…
