<h1>Brawler Tier</h1>

<p>
  “Okay yeah, a T-shirt and lanyard or whatever is great, but what if I’m craving MORE?” Well, I’m glad you asked! The Brawler Tier adds a huge variety of exclusive celebratory gear to your merch order, none of which will be sold at our standard merch booth. So grab it while it’s still available! You’ll receive:
</p>

<p>
  A Super MAGFest Melee Drawstring Bag (a nice one, of course), a custom designed “[ GET SWEATY ]” Rally Towel, the King’s Pennant, a Printed Water Bottle featuring our full roster of characters, GAMER BLOOD™ Sports Drink, a 12-card MAG TGC Card Pack, No-Johns™ Hand Warmers, Foam Finger Horns 🤘, and maybe an extra surprise or two along the way. Note, we’re still finalizing our Brawler Tier pack, so certain items/designs/quantities are subject to change. But, as always, we’ll make sure you’re getting a huge bang for your buck!
