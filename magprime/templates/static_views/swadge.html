<h3 align="center">Swag + Badge = SWADGE</h3>

<p>
In addition to your attendee badge, add on a custom personalized keepsake
swadge to accompany it. This swadge is a fully functional wifi-enabled
circuit board that interacts with features all over the event! We're working
to develop things like syncrhonized concert lights, hallway games, leaderboards,
and more.
