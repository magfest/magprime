<h1>Swag + Badge = SWADGE</h1>

<p>
  In addition to your attendee badge, add on a custom personalized keepsake
  swadge to accompany it. This swadge is a fully functional wifi-enabled
  circuit board that interacts with features all over the event! We're working
  to develop things like synchronized concert lights, hallway games,
  leaderboards, and more.
