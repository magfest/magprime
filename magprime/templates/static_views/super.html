<h1>ULTIMATE Tier</h1>

<p>
  This is the Mamma-McJamma of all merch packages, right here! We’ve truly never had this much incredible swag in one pack, and we’re so excited to finally announce this 20th Anniversary celebration of gear! Let’s go through just some of the items included in the ULTIMATE Tier:

<ul>
  <li><strong>Final Festination Duffel Bag</strong> – If you’re familiar with Fangamer, you know the the quality of their merch is second-to-none. And this custom designed duffel bag is no different. Perfect for lugging around your GameCube, a small TV, and two controllers so you can be ready to 1v1 (no items, of course) with anyone who just looks at you the wrong way.</li>
  <li><strong>M***** O* C********* Roaring Sound Drop Keychain</strong> – Wait. Why the censoring? Well, we’ve got some other things to reveal before we give you the full details on this item. But the important thing? With the press of one button you can let out a Mighty MAGFest Roar from the comfort of your own keychain!</li>
  <li><strong>Wash Yo’ Self Engraved Soap</strong> – What better way to rid yourself of that tourney funk after a few sweaty Smash matches than with your own bar of artisanal engraved soap! Hey, personal hygiene ain’t no joke, and we want only the freshest for our attendees.</li>
  <li><strong>Perfect Posture Pillow: Max Butt Comfort</strong> – This memory foam pillow, sporting our circular thematic logo, is perfect for protecting your cheeks from pancaking too hard on your seat. Okay, you can also use it as a pillow to rest your head on, and it’s truly wonderful for that. But butts are funnier, so that’s how I’m marketing it.</li>
  <li><strong>Super Swadge, aka the “SquareWaveBird”</strong> – Not gonna lie, this year’s Swadge is actually nuts. Rocking 8 LEDs, a full color LCD screen, 10+ modes, 8 buttons, a touch pad, accelerometer, microphone, buzzer, and an updated chipset, this is an absolute Giga Swadge. We’ll have much more information later, but you can expect a full platform fighter featuring MAGFest’s past mascots as characters, playable wirelessly with your friends. Plus so many more games, modes, Easter Eggs, and more! Oh, and did we mention that our open source Swadge is now fully programmable via USB-C?</li>
  <li><strong>Secret Invite to the CRAZY PERSON Tier</strong> – Those who are in the know are probably grinning ear-to-ear right now. Making a triumphant return, after a few years of absence, we’ll be offering an even HIGHER, more expensive tier of merch for the truly bat-poop insane. But to even be invited to see what it is, you gotta grab the ULTIMATE package first. All I can say is it’s, by far, the coolest and most limited merch we’ve ever had in our org’s history.</li>
  <li><strong>PLUS ALL THIS OTHER AWESOME MERCH</strong> – You know you’re gettin’ the shirt, pin, and lanyard already, but what about quenching your thirst with some GAMER BLOOD™ in our custom character water bottle? Bring the celebration home with our King Pennant and Foam Finger-horns, too! Prep for your Smash tourney with our [not really] patent-pending “No Johns™ Hand Warmers”, then dry your sweat with our [ GET SWEATY ] rally towel. Tabletops more your thing? We’ve got you covered with out MAG TCG Card Pack, where you’ll get 12 unique MAGFest cards. (Will we make a real game out of it?? Who knows!) All this, and more items and surprises on the way!</li>
</ul>
