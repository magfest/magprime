<h1>BIGMA Tier</h1>

<p>
  This pack is for the real Mavericks out there. Now, you already know you get everything from the previous two tiers, but there‚Äôs much more to enjoy in this beefy boy.
</p>

<p>
  Let‚Äôs start with a set of Neon Acrylic Coasters, the perfect companions for respecting wood. And no beverage platform would be complete without a bartender-style Flat Steel Bottle Opener, featuring our 2026 mascots, of course. 
</p>

<p>
  Then you‚Äôll get a pair of ultra-high-quality Cyber Socks, and if you got the Maniac Tier from last year, you already know how damn nice those socks are. And this year‚Äôs are even better.
</p>

<p>
  Bringing the mood in a bit, we‚Äôve included a Circuit Lemon Candle Tin, as well as a themed Hand Towel. Not sure why I bundled those together, but whatever, don‚Äôt be weird.
</p>

<p>
  And when you‚Äôre starting to feel sleepy, have a rest on the included Arm Cannon Pillow, which you can wear on your arm and pretend to blast away all those evil robots the world will eventually be filled with. Legit, though, this pillow is perfect for plopping your head down at a desk or on a flight.
</p>

<p>
  Finally, it‚Äôs all bundled up in our very first MAGFest Sling Bag, completely custom created from scratch to fit your portable game systems, phones, keys, whatever you want! We‚Äôre super excited about this bag‚Äîit‚Äôs been in development for a long time.
</p>

<p>
  But THAT‚ÄôS NOT ALL! There may even be a surprise or two for you to discover at Super MAGFest. We really tried to pour everything into these merch packs, so we hope you enjoy them. And as always, all of this merch is exclusive to the pre-order packs and will not be available for purchase at the event. So grab it before it‚Äôs gone!
</p>

<p>
DID YOU KNOW... there's even a super secret CRAZY tier of merch, available by invite only. And the only way to score that invite is to pre-order the BIGMA Tier merch... üëÄ You're going to want to act fast, though! Historically, the highest tier of merch sells out very quickly.
Head over to <a href="http://super.magfest.org/registration" target="_blank">our registration info page</a> to get more details!
</p>

<p>
  NOTE: In order to receive an invite to the Secret ‚ÄúCRAZY TIER‚Äù, you <strong>MUST PURCHASE THE BIGMA TIER BY SEPTEMBER 30TH</strong>.
