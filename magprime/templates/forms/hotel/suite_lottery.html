    Suite entries are processed during the attendee lottery.
    You will receive the standard room that you select in the next step.
    Then, if you win a suite in the attendee lottery, your room booking will be cancelled and you will receive instructions on how to book your suite.
    {% else %}
    Suite entries are processed first and prioritized above standard room entries in the lottery.

    Suites are in extremely high demand, and necessitate special policies:
    <ul>
        <li>A one night, non-refundable deposit is required and will be invoiced on confirmation of the suite.</li>
        <li>Cancellations must be received on or prior to {{ c.HOTEL_LOTTERY_SUITE_CUTOFF|datetime_local }}, otherwise all guests in that suite will be ineligible for future year suite lotteries in addition to forfeiting the deposit.</li>
        <li>All suites are directly managed by {{ c.EVENT_NAME }}. Suite confirmations are issued by the convention, not the hotel.</li>
        <li>Additional policies apply to suites. It is essential all attendees requesting a suite read and understand these policies, as you are required to comply as a condition of retaining the suite during the event, and for eligibility in future years.</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>If awarded a suite, you will receive additional information via email regarding your suite.</p>

<p>Suite policies, floor plans and other details pertaining to suites may be found on the Suite FAQ.</p>
