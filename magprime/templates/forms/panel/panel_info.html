        MAGScouts guides younger attendees and their adults to age-appropriate content at MAGFest events. 
        <br/><br/>Marking your content as “MAGScouts-approved” means that demographic will be encouraged to attend, and that your content will be presented in a manner that is appropriate for all audiences.
        <br/><br/>This doesn't mean your content has to be "for kids" only, just that it should be accessible and inoffensive to younger attendees!
